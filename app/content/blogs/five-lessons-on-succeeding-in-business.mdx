title: "5 Lessons on Succeeding in Business"
---

Running and studying businesses for years has taught me a few things that matter more than most advice.

## 1. Distribution beats ideas

A great idea without distribution is useless.  
Sales, marketing, and networks matter more than cleverness.

## 2. Speed compounds

Shipping early gives you feedback.  
Feedback gives you leverage.

**Perfection is usually fear in disguise.**

## 3. Focus is a competitive advantage

Most startups fail because they try to do too many things at once.

- One customer
- One problem
- One channel

## 4. Incentives shape behavior

People respond to incentives, not mission statements.

## 5. Consistency wins long-term

Small progress, repeated, beats bursts of motivation.
